Installed and used uuid 

    Try again in just JS
        installed for simple local javascript using "npm install uuid"
        used "import {v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';"
        it did not work inside of React file upon further reading may only work for JS files and not JSX files

    HOW DO I UNINSTALL something also is there any reason to gloablly install any of this thing
    Also I think I must have installed react Globally is this true?


    This works in react
        installed "npm i react-uuid" to local folder
        used  "import uuid from 'react-uuid';"
        it worked! 

    I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH VERSION I INSTALLED?
    version 1,4, and 7
        1 - uses MAC address and Timestamp for working id gen
        4 - uses random number generator
        7 - using a timestamp, a counter and a cryptographically strong random number (basically better randomness than one)
