Installed and used uuid 

installed for simple local javascript using "npm install uuid"
used "import {v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';"
it did not work inside of React file upon further reading may only work for JS files and not JSX files

installed "npm i react-uuid" to local folder
used  "import uuid from 'react-uuid';"
it worked!
